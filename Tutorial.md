Hello,

Welcome to the first CompoMe tutorial.

In this tutorial, we will build together a simple SoundBox application.
The goal of this application is to play sounds that can be controlled through different interfaces such as HTTP, TCP, or DBus.

We will focus on discovering and using the tools provided by CompoMe rather than on the implementation details of the sound logic itself.
